Code for app with basic controls for LED strips 

Code for Arduino Chip LED strip control and customization

Code paths:

Both LEDControl folders are responsible for the swift app code

-LEDcontrol.xcodeproj contains the files to run on Xcode which is not availale unless running on a mac device 

-LEDControl Folder:

  -Controllers: Holds the files that contain the different views that I programmed as well   as other view for bluetooth which were mainly imported
  -Model: Basic Files imported for the Bluetooth sections to use                                                    
  -View: Basic File imported for the Bluetooth section

  All other paths hold information that is generated based on story board view and is in   HTML
